SMART CLOAKROOM LOCKER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING IOT FOR SECURE STORAGE
 â€” A secure, cloud-connected locker system that replaces traditional token-based cloakrooms with PIN-based access, postpaid billing, IoT control, and blockchain-secured payments.

The Smart Cloakroom Locker Management System using IoT is a cloud-connected locker solution designed to replace traditional key or token-based cloakrooms with a secure, digital approach. It enables users to book lockers online, set personalized PINs, and pay after usage through a postpaid billing model. Powered by ESP32, arduino uno, Firebase and RFID, the system offers real-time monitoring, flexible payment options, blockchain-secured transactions, and admin override features. This project ensures transparency, convenience, and enhanced security for locker management in public spaces like railway stations, malls, and airports.
